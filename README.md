Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Visualizes cancellation patterns using interactive charts

Tests hypotheses to identify key drivers of churn

Evaluates the impact of removing high-risk customer segments

🧰 Technologies Used

Python 3

Pandas – Data manipulation

Plotly Express – Interactive visualizations

📈 Hypotheses Tested

Customers who call the call center more than 4 times are more likely to cancel.

Customers with monthly subscriptions tend to cancel more.

Customers with more than 20 days of payment delay are more likely to cancel.

Each hypothesis is tested by filtering the dataset and observing the change in cancellation rates.

⚠️ Notes

Dataset is anonymized and used for educational purposes.

Visualizations are generated dynamically and require a GUI environment to display.

Ensure all required libraries are installed before running the script.
